# DataEvolver

**Autonomous Synthetic Data Construction via VLM-Guided Iterative Rendering**

DataEvolver is a goal-driven data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality training datasets through an automated loop of 3D rendering, VLM (Vision-Language Model) quality review, and intelligent parameter adjustment. Unlike traditional pipelines with rigid scoring rules, DataEvolver uses free-form VLM feedback to perceive, diagnose, and fix rendering issues — producing photorealistic, scene-aware training data without human intervention.

## Key Features

- **Goal-Driven Loop Agents** — VLM reviewer provides semantic feedback ("flat lighting", "floating object") &rarr; AI agent selects targeted actions &rarr; re-render &rarr; repeat until quality goals are met
- **24 Atomic Actions** — Structured action space across 5 groups: lighting, object placement, scene environment, and material properties — with anti-oscillation control and step-scale scheduling
- **Scene-Aware Rendering** — Objects placed in real Blender scenes with HDRI environments, raycast ground detection, and preserved scene lighting
- **Multi-Modal Output** — RGB, mask, depth, normal maps, and geometry metadata
- **End-to-End Automation** — From natural language seed concept to training-ready dataset, zero human intervention
- **Universal 3D Layout Contract** — Multi-paper 3D-control dataset schema with Blender targets, object masks, OSCR/structure views, camera metadata, scene graph, and VLM loop traces

```

**Anti-oscillation control** prevents parameter thrashing:
- Sign-flip tracking: freeze a parameter after 3 direction reversals
- Step-scale scheduling: Round 0 → 100%, Round 1 → 70%, Round 2 → 50%, Round 3+ → 40%
- Score-adaptive boost: &times;1.2 when hybrid_score < 0.65

## Action Space

The AI agent selects from **24 structured atomic actions** organized in 5 groups:

| Group | Actions | Parameters |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Lighting** (4) | Key light intensity &uarr;&darr;, key light yaw &plusmn;15&deg; | Multiplicative &times;1.2/&times;0.8 or additive, bounded |
| **Object** (6) | Elevation &plusmn;0.02, yaw &plusmn;15&deg;, scale &times;1.1/&times;0.9 | Bounded within safe ranges |
| **Scene** (5) | Env rotation &plusmn;30&deg;, env intensity &uarr;&darr;, contact shadow | HDRI and environment controls |
| **Material** (9) | Saturation, value/brightness, hue offset, roughness, specular/sheen | Fine-grained material tuning |
| **Camera** (0) | Reserved for future use | — |

## DataEvolver-Rotate

The first benchmark dataset produced by DataEvolver — for rotation-conditioned image editing.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Unique Objects | 50 |
| Rotation Angles | 8 (0&deg;, 45&deg;, 90&deg;, 135&deg;, 180&deg;, 225&deg;, 270&deg;, 315&deg;) |
| Training Pairs | 350 (front &rarr; 7 target views) |
| Train / Val / Test | 245 / 49 / 56 pairs (object-disjoint, seed=42) |
| Modalities | RGB, mask, depth, normal |

### Methodology

Each object uses a single **canonical yaw-0&deg; best state** as the base. The object is then rotated while the scene, camera, lighting, and material remain fixed — ensuring cross-angle consistency.

### Loading the Dataset

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image

root = Path("path/to/dataset_split")
rows = []
with (root / "pairs" / "train_pairs.jsonl").open("r") as f:
    for line in f:
        rows.append(json.loads(line))

row = rows[0]
source = Image.open(root / row["source_image"]).convert("RGB")
target = Image.open(root / row["target_image"]).convert("RGB")
instruction = row["instruction"]  # e.g., "Rotate the object 45 degrees clockwise"
```

## Universal 3D Layout Dataset

DataEvolver also includes a universal 3D layout dataset workflow derived from
the shared data requirements of six related 3D-control papers. It generates
Blender-backed records with target renders, per-object masks, OSCR/structure
views, depth-order proxies, orientation proxies, camera metadata, scene graph,
occlusion relations and VLM loop traces.

Public workflow docs:
[`docs/UNIVERSAL_3D_LAYOUT_DATASET.md`](docs/UNIVERSAL_3D_LAYOUT_DATASET.md)

Tracked schema:
[`configs/schemas/universal_3d_layout_dataset_schema.json`](configs/schemas/universal_3d_layout_dataset_schema.json)

Tracked scripts:
[`scripts/universal_3d_layout/`](scripts/universal_3d_layout/)

The generated datasets are runtime artifacts and are not committed to this
repository.

## Using with Claude Code

DataEvolver is designed to work with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) as an AI-powered development and operations assistant. Claude Code reads a project-level `CLAUDE.md` file to understand your environment, then helps you run pipelines, analyze results, and build datasets through natural language.

### Step 1: Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Step 2: Create your `CLAUDE.md`

Create a `CLAUDE.md` in the project root (it's gitignored — each user maintains their own). This file tells Claude Code about your specific environment:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Remote Server
- SSH alias: `my-server`
- GPU: 3x A800 80GB (or your setup)
- Python: `/path/to/python3` (3.10+, with PyTorch)
- Blender: `/path/to/blender` (4.2.4)
- Code directory: `/path/to/DataEvolver`

## Model Paths
- Qwen-Image-2512: `/path/to/Qwen-Image-2512`
- SAM3 checkpoint: `/path/to/sam3/sam3.pt`
- Hunyuan3D-2.1 repo: `/path/to/Hunyuan3D-2.1`
- Hunyuan3D-2.1 weights: `/path/to/model_hub/Hunyuan3D-2.1`
- Qwen3.5-35B-A3B: `/path/to/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B`

## Scene Config
- Blender scene file: `/path/to/scene.blend`
- HDRI directory: `/path/to/hdri/`
- Render engine: CYCLES, 512 samples, 1024x1024

## Key Configs
- Action space: `configs/scene_action_space.json` (24 atomic actions)
- Scene template: `configs/scene_template.json`
- Dataset profiles: `configs/dataset_profiles/`

## Pipeline
Stage 1 (Text Expansion) → Stage 2 (T2I) → Stage 2.5 (SAM3)
→ Stage 3 (3D Reconstruction) → Stage 4 (Blender Render) → Stage 5 (VLM Loop)

## Working Rules
- Always test on the remote server, not locally
- Use tmux for long-running tasks (screen not available on all servers)
- Read trace.json free-form text for VLM results — not just agg.json scores
- Only stop VLM loop when reviewer explicitly says "keep"
- Check GPU usage before launching new jobs
```

### Step 3: Create Claude Code Skills (Optional)

You can create reusable skills in a `skills/` directory for common workflows:

```bash
mkdir -p skills/scene-agent-loop
```

```markdown
# skills/scene-agent-loop/SKILL.md
---
name: scene-agent-loop
description: Manage the VLM review loop for scene rendering
---
# Scene Agent Loop
Monitor and continue the VLM review → render → agent decision loop.
Read trace.json to understand current state, then decide next action.
```

### Step 4: Launch Claude Code

```bash
cd DataEvolver
claude
```

Claude Code will read your `CLAUDE.md` and understand the full project context. Example commands:

```
> Check GPU usage on the server
> Run the full pipeline for 10 new furniture objects
> Export rotation8 dataset from the latest best states
> Build train-ready dataset with object-disjoint split
```

## Roadmap

### Completed

- [x] **WebSearch-integrated AI Agent** — Stage0 WebSearch supports both single-paper reproduction and multi-paper universal dataset modes. It records paper evidence, exports handoff documents, and has been validated on the remote rendering environment.
- [x] **Multi-paper universal 3D dataset synthesis** — the workflow starts from an anchor paper, expands to related 3D-control papers, and extracts shared dataset requirements for target images, masks, OSCR/structure views, camera metadata, object layout, occlusion relations, scene graphs, and validation traces.
- [x] **Universal 3D layout dataset contract** — DataEvolver now tracks a reusable schema for Blender-backed target renders, per-object masks, structure views, depth-order proxies, orientation proxies, camera pose/intrinsics/viewpoint tokens, mesh metadata, 3D boxes, scene graphs, spatial relations, and promotion decisions.
- [x] **Blender-backed dual-object scenes** — the current universal 3D workflow can generate real-scene, dual-object records with DataEvolver scene and mesh assets. General N-object compositional scenes remain a separate extension.
- [x] **VLM/CV self-evolution loop** — selected universal 3D records can be reviewed with calibrated hybrid VLM and CV geometry scores, bounded repair actions, and explicit accept/reject promotion traces.
- [x] **Paper-specific and universal export modes** — the WebSearch and universal layout scripts support both single-paper dataset reproduction and multi-paper universal schema export.

### In Progress

- [ ] **Structured VLM knowledge base** — current scoring already uses structured VLM/CV criteria, mask coverage checks, depth-order proxy checks, geometry-review metadata, and a VGGT-Omega proxy hook. A persistent prior-knowledge store for reusable VLM assessment criteria is still under development.
- [ ] **Real-world dataset ingestion** — WebSearch can discover public datasets and paper resources, and public artifacts such as SeeThrough3D are used as references. A full crawl-clean-process-ingest pipeline for arbitrary real-world datasets is still pending.
- [ ] **Auto-generated reasoning-evaluation datasets** — current records include validation logs, hybrid scores, and promotion traces. Fully automated benchmark generation after downstream model training remains a future release target.
- [ ] **General N-object compositional scenes** — beyond the current dual-object workflow, this requires relation-aware sampling, collision handling, occlusion planning, and stronger multi-object VLM/CV review.

### Pending

- [ ] **Video object datasets** — extend image-level rendering to temporally consistent object removal, translation, rotation, insertion, and attribute editing across frames.
- [ ] **Temporal review and filtering** — add sequence-level checks for flicker, trajectory smoothness, mask stability, depth continuity, and action consistency.
- [ ] **Large-scale public dataset ingestion** — scale WebSearch-discovered dataset ingestion into repeatable crawling, cleaning, licensing, provenance, and structured export workflows.
